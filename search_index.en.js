their super-class the mage, focus on manipulating magical energies rather than defeating foes in combat.\nUnlike mages, however, illusionists specialize in assaulting the target’s cognition and vision, leading their enemies to believe mirages and ignore the truth.\nTo be able to use such powerful magic, they must study far longer than most mages, often under the tutelage of an alchemist, scribe or other learned figure.\nDriven by the accumulation of knowledge, powerful illusionists may live their entire existence within illusions that are themselves part of greater illusions.\nAbility Scores\nIllusionists' primary attribute is intelligence.\nIllusionists must have an intelligence of 15 or higher and a dexterity of 16 or higher.\nMulti-classed illusionists must have an intelligence of 16 or higher.\nIllusionists do not gain any experience bonuses.\nIllusionists benefit from a high constitution for surviving combat.\nCombat\nIllusionists use 4-sided hit dice.\nIllusionists cannot wear any armour and may use only basic weapons: clubs, daggers, darts and quarterstaffs.\nIllusionists begin with one weapon proficiency and take a -5 penalty \"to hit\" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.\nA new weapon proficiency is gained for every six levels above the first.\nIllusionists can use virtually any magic items.\nSkills\nUnder normal circumstances, illusionists are able to read.\nSkills available to illusionists include:\n\nalchemy\narchitecture\nastrology &amp; astronomy\ncosmology\nengineering\nfolklore\ngeology\nhistory\nlaw\nlinguistics\nmercantilism\nphilosophy\nphysics\npolitics\n\nAt first level, illusionists gain 8 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.\nIllusionists gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.\nExperience Table\n\nLevelMin.

additional level above 12th.\nIllusionists gain 1 h.p. per level above 10th.\nSpell Acquisition &amp; Use\nSpellbooks\nAs a means to concentrate on and study magic, illusionists may store the symbols and words of their cantrips and spells in books or scrolls.\nThe series of symbols and words is known as the 'incantation' of a spell, which must be studied in order for the magic to follow the illusionist's whim.\nMore powerful spells require longer incantations, which are measured in 'quires'.\nThe standard length of one quire is sixteen nine-by-twelve inch pages.\nAs books can vary in size, the quire provides a simple unit for recording incantation size.\nA single cantrip requires 1/32 of a quire.\nA given spell level requires 1/16 of a quire by level, i.e. a fifth level spell requires 5/16 of a quire.\nOnce a book or scroll is filled, the illusionist must acquire a new book or scroll to write in future spells.\nWhen new spells are acquired, it is presumed that the illusionist is able to hold them in memory until such time as they can be transcribed in a spellbook.\nSpell Recovery\nOnce a cantrip or spell has been cast, the illusionist must study the cantrip or spell again in their spellbook after a period of overnight rest (typically six hours).\nIllusionist Spell Table I.: Cantrips\n\nCantrip Type Number Gained at First Level Roll\nHaunting sound 1d3

Table I.\nNumber Gained at First Level states the number of cantrips acquired at first level.\nEach subsequent cantrip after first level may be chosen by rolling a percentile die to determine the

due to range as follows:\n\npoint blank: add 1\nshort: no change\nmedium: subtract 2\nlong: subtract 5\n\nMissile weapons cannot be used against targets immediately in front of the combatant (1 hex), as the combatants are considered in hand-to-hand combat.\nCrossbows\nCrossbows are made up of three separate components: the mechanism, the stock and the bowstring.\nBowstrings and bolts must be purchased for the crossbow separately.\nBreakage\nWhen a die roll indicates that the crossbow has broken, roll a d10 to determine the part that has broken:\n\nRoll Broken part\n1 mechanism\n2–3 stock\n4–10 bowstring\n\nWhen crossbow bolts are fired at hard surfaces, they will break on a 1 in 4.\nLoading\nLight crossbows require two rounds to load, and may be fired on the third round.\nHeavy crossbows require three rounds to load, and may be fired on the fourth round.\nCrossbows can be part-loaded prior to use.\nA bowman may load a crossbow one round short of being fully loaded and keep it in this state for up to one hour without great loss of springiness.\nFurthermore, once fully loaded a crossbow can be kept \"at the ready\" for up to ten rounds without seriously affecting the bowstring.\nOnce a crossbow has been part-loaded three times, its bowstring will be sufficiently weak that it can no longer be part-loaded and will automatically break after the next use.\nSpears\nSpears longer than 8 feet are treated as pikes.\nSpears may be set against charge.\nThe spear must be planted in the ground and held with the foot.\nAn attack can then be made for double damage against a charging opponent; regardless of whether or not the attack succeeds, the spear will then be considered unset.\nIf the spear-holder is stunned, the spear will no longer be considered set.\nArmours\nArmour Table I.: Body Armours\n\nArmour AC improvement Weight\nPadded armour 1 10 lb.\nLeather armour 2 10 lb.\nStudded leather armour 3 15 lb.\nRing mail 3 20 lb.\nScale mail 4 25

There are four basic approaches available (calculated based on the effectiveness of birth control methods), as follows.\n\nContraceptive MethodRisk of pregnancy per sexual encounter\nNone, deliberately while ovulating5 in 20\nNone1 in 20\nCalendar-based1 in 20, on a 1 roll vs. lowest WIS between partners\nWithdrawal method or barrier device1 in 20, on a 1 roll vs. highest WIS between partners\nAbortifacient consumed at most 8 hours after sex1 in 200\n\nBarrier devices include citrus; a mixture of cedar oil, incense and olive oil; and a mixture of honey and rock salt.\nAbortifacients include pennyroyal, rue, wild carrot, silphium and nutmeg.\nIf a character conceives, they roll a d100. If a 1 is rolled, the character conceives twins and rolls again. Each additional 1 rolled increases the number of children by 1.\nFirst Trimester (weeks 1 to 12)\nThe first trimester is characterized by feelings of tiredness and nausea. The chance of miscarriage is relatively high, especially in women who do not experience much morning sickness.\nPenalties\n\nSuffer -1 'to hit' rolls.\nAfter any combat in which 5 or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-3 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.\nWhen character has not eaten within the past 8 hours, must make a save vs. poison or will vomit for 1d4 rounds. If character fails at least 10 saves, nausea continues into second trimester (hyperemesis gravidarum).\n\nSecond Trimester (weeks 13 to 28)\nThe second trimester is the period of significant weight gain; the character will typically gain between 10-15% of their current weight in placenta, retained fluids and baby. The character is no longer as nauseous unless they develop hyperemesis gravidarum (see first trimester, penalties). The character may begin to feel more tender and sore. The character may become constipated or have frequent urination (pressure on the bowels and bladder). The chance of miscarriage is much lower than in the first trimester.\nPenalties\n\nSuffer -1 'to hit' rolls.\nAfter any combat in which five or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-3 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.\nCharacter must consume an additional 1 lb. of food a day.\nCharacter loses an additional 2% of their body water a day (risk of [[dehydration|Hydration]]).\n\nThird Trimester (weeks 29 to 40)\nThe third trimester is similar to the second, although the baby grows much larger and heavier, causing increased muscle, girdle and back pain, and reducing the character's balance. The chance of miscarriage is quite low, but the character can enter preeclampsia (leading to seizures and/or coma) due to high blood pressure or stress.\nPenalties\n\nSuffer -1 'to hit' rolls and DEX checks.\nAfter any combat in which five or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-4 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.\nCharacter must consume an additional 1 lb. of food a day.\nCharacter loses an additional 2% of their body water a day (risk of [[dehydration|Hydration]]).\nWhenever character's CON drops below 3, character must save vs. paralyzation or succumb to preeclampsia. The character must rest completely for 2-8 days and make a CON check each day. If more than half the checks fail, the character will enter eclampsia.\n\nDelivery\n(Work in progress.)\nMiscarriage\nMiscarriage affects around 20% of pregnancies. Miscarriage can occur naturally at any time during the pregnancy due to a number of different complications. The chance of miscarriage is highest at the beginning of the pregnancy and steadily decreases over time. Note that physical injury can increase the chance of miscarriage.\nAs most miscarriages are not immediately obvious to the mother until quite late in the pregnancy (or even until delivery), the DM should roll on the player's behalf.\n\nWeek123-1213-1415-2122-2627-3334-40\nChance3%2%1%0.5%0.25%0.2%0.1%0.05%\n\nChance of miscarriage is rolled automatically at the end of each week.\nWhenever a character is [stunned](http://tao-dndwiki.blogspot.ca/2018/02/stun-lock.html) in combat, the DM must roll double the miscarriage chance (i.e. if the character is stunned in combat during the 11th week, the miscarriage chance is 2 x 1% = 2%) immediately.\nFor multiple births, miscarriage chance is multiplied by the number of living offspring. Each baby miscarries separately.\n","id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/pregnancy/","title":"Pregnancy"},"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/characters/bard/":{"id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/characters/bard/","body":"Bard\nBards are artists seeking to create and present an artistry that will engage their audience.\nThrough their artistic training, they harness the wild magic of the universe and modulate it using their craft.\nBards are often sociable, joining together for performances or festivals, and at times forming colleges to establish formal aesthetics.\nOther bards may instead seek independence and isolation from the rigour of the college.\nLike druids, bards are not bound to a strict form of expression, but may choose to follow their artistic desires in whatever form best empowers them.\nEvery bard may choose an artistic path to follow, of which many exist: acting, architecture, ceramics, circus, costuming, dance, gastronomy, leathercraft, metalwork, music, painting, poetry, prose, puppetry, sculpture and woodwork.\nAbility Scores\nBards' primary attribute is charisma.\nBards must have a wisdom of 13 or higher, an intelligence of 10 or higher, and a charisma of 15 or higher.\nMulti-classed bards must have a wisdom of 15 or higher.\nBards do not receive experience point bonuses.\nBards play best with a high constitution for defense.\nAll ability scores for the bard must be 6 or higher.\nCombat\nBards use 6-sided hit dice.\nBards may use padded, leather, studded leather or chain mail armours only.\nThey may not use shields or great helmets.\nBards may use the following weapons: ankuses, bastard swords, bolas, broadswords, clubs, light crossbows, daggers, darts, javelins, longswords, quarterstaffs, scimitars, short hammers, shortswords, slings, spears, staff slings, two-handed swords and warhammers.\nBards begin with two weapon proficiencies and take a -3 penalty \"to hit\" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.\nA new weapon proficiency is gained for every three levels above the first.\nBards are able to employ any magic items normally available to fighters and thieves.\nSkills\nUnder normal circumstances, bards are able to read.\nAll bards have the ability to play martial music.\nBards must choose one of the aforementioned artistic forms to specialize in in addition to their usual skills.\nEach time the bard gains a level, they gain a corresponding level in their specialty.\nThey may respecialize in a new form, but will begin at level 1 and have to retrain to achieve the same bonuses in their skills that they had before.\nSome skills are available across forms, and will not be penalized if the bard changes specialties.\nOthers are only available within a specific subset of forms.\nSkills available to bards include:\n\nartistry\ncraftsmanship\ncreativity\nengineering\nfolklore\nheraldry\nhistory\ninspiration\ninstruction\nlinguistics\nperformance\nphilosophy\nphysics\npolitics\n\nAt first level, bards gain 6 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.\nAt first level, bards automatically gain 2 points in performance and 2 points in inspiration.\nBards gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.\nMartial Music\nBards are able to play martial music for as long as 4 round per level per day.\nWith each level gained, it can be supposed that the bard is able to produce musical variation to continue to inspire allies, and that their bodies can handle the strain of performance longer.\nIt requires one full round of playing before martial music can have any kind of effect; thereafter, every round the music is played will have positive effects towards the player's allies.\nThe bard may not perform any activity while producing martial music beyond moving 1 hex, so long as this does not move them into melee.\nFriendly combatants within 12 hexes (60 feet) of the player will gain +1 to hit, +1 to damage and +1 morale as long as the bard is playing.\nSo long as the bard has not performed for the full number of rounds of martial music they may produce a day, they may stop and start again as often as they wish.\nThey must warm up again for one round however; note that this warm-up does not count towards the total number of rounds of martial music the bard may play in a day.\nExperience Table\nBards are limited to 23 levels.\n\nLevelMin.

Subtraction from or addition to the number rolled is made according to the table as applicable.\nDamage Adjustment likewise applies to melee combat. The damage done by scoring a successful hit on an opponent is adjusted downwards or upwards as applicable. Thus, if a hit would normally score 1-6 hit points of damage upon the opponent, and the character’s strength was only 3, the actual damage done would be reduced by 1 point; but, on the other hand, if the attacker had strength of 18/00, the actual damage done would be adjusted upwards by 6 hit points, and possible damage would jump from 1-6 to 7-12.\nWeight Allowance is given in terms of maximum percentage of body weight which the character can carry unencumbered (See Movement). A 100 lb. character with a strength of 3 could carry 5 lb. unencumbered; if the same character instead had a strength of 18/00, they could carry 170 lb. unencumbered.\nOpen Doors indicates the number of chances out of 6 which the character has of opening a stuck or heavy door on that try. Successive attempts may be made at no penalty with regard to damage to the character attempting to force the door open, but each such attempt requires time and makes considerable noise.\nBend Bars/Lift Gates states the percentage chance the character has of bending normal soft iron bars or of lifting a vertically moving gate (such as a small portcullis barring a passage). The attempt may be made but once, and if the score required is not made, the character will never succeed in the task.\nIntelligence\nIntelligence includes mnemonic ability, reasoning, and learning ability outside those measured by the written word.\nIntelligence affects a character's ability to learn new skills and improve their understanding thereof.\nIntelligence is the major characteristic of mages, and those with intelligence of 16 or more gain a bonus of 10% of earned experience.\nIntelligence Table I.\n\nAbility ScoreGeneral InformationKnowledge Adjustment\n3-3\n4Minimum intelligence for a half-elf character-2\n5Here or lower the character can only be a fighter-1\n6Minimum intelligence for a halfling character-1\n7Minimum intelligence for a gnome character-1\n8Minimum intelligence for an elf character0\n9Minimum intelligence for a paladin or mage character0\n10Minimum intelligence for use of 5th level magic spells0\n11Minimum intelligence for an assassin character0\n12Minimum intelligence for use of 6th level magic spells0\n13Minimum intelligence for a ranger character0\n14Minimum intelligence for use of 7th level magic spells0\n15Minimum intelligence for an illusionist character1\n16Minimum intelligence for use of 8th level magic spells1\n17Maximum intelligence for a half-orc character1\n18Minimum intelligence for use of 9th level magic spells2\n193\n\nNotes on Intelligence Table I.\nKnowledge Adjustment states the roll bonus when gaining new knowledge points.\nOn level up, when a character gains additional points of knowledge in skills, they add or subtract the score from their roll as applicable.\nNote that the lowest roll for knowledge points earned per level is 1.\nIntelligence Table II.: Ability for Mages\n\nAbility ScoreChance to Know Each Listed SpellMin # of Spells/LevelMax # of Spells/Level\n935%46\n10-1245%57\n13-1455%69\n15-1665%711\n1775%814\n1885%918\n19 or more95%10All\n\nNotes regarding Intelligence Table II.\nWhenever a new spell level becomes available, a mage must roll against each possible spell listed of that level to know which of these spells they will be able to learn. These are checked only the one time that a new spell level becomes available.\nChance to Know Each Listed Spell pertains to the percentage chance the character has to learn any given spell in the level group. The character may select spells desired in any order they wish. Each spell may be checked only once. Percentile dice are rolled, and if the number generated is equal to or less than the percentage chance shown, then the character can learn and thus know that spell if acquired and added to the character’s spell book.\nMin # of Spells/Level states the fewest number of spells by level group that a mage can learn. If one complete check through all spells in the level group fails to generate the minimum number given, the character may selectively go back through the group, checking each spell they failed to know once again. This process continues until the minimum number requirement has been fulfilled. This means, then, that certain spells, when located, can be learned – while certain other spells can never be learned and the dice rolls indicate which ones are in each category.\nMax # of Spells/Level is the obverse of the minimum number which can be known by a mage (i.e. the maximum number they can have in their spell books). As soon as this maximum is reached, the character may not check any further in the level group.\nChange in Intelligence: If intelligence goes down or up for any reason, and such change is relatively permanent, the mage must check again as explained above for known spells by level group.\nAcquisition of Heretofore Unknown Spells: Although the mage must immediately cease checking to determine if spells are known after the first complete check of each spell in the level group, or immediately thereafter during successive checks when the minimum number of spells which can be known is reached, it is possible to acquire knowledge of additional spells previously unknown as long as this does not violate the maximum number of spells which can be known. New spells can be gained from captured or otherwise acquired spell books or from scrolls of magic spells. In the latter event the scroll is destroyed in learning and knowing the new spell or spells. (This subject is detailed more fully in the section explaining mages as characters.)\nWisdom\nWisdom is a composite term for the character’s judgement, wile, will power, and (to a certain extent) intuitiveness.\nWisdom is of utmost importance to clerics, their major characteristic, and those with wisdom of 16 or greater add 10% to earned experience.\nFurthermore, clerics with exceptional wisdom (16 or greater) also gain bonus spells over and above the number they are normally able to use.\nWisdom Table I.\n\nAbility Score General Information Magical Attack Adjustment†\n3  -3\n4  -2\n5 Here or lower the character can only be a thief -1\n6  -1\n7  -1\n8  0\n9 Minimum wisdom for a cleric character 0\n10  0\n11  0\n12 Minimum wisdom for a druid character 0\n13 Minimum wisdom for a paladin or multi-classed half-elven cleric character 0\n14 Minimum wisdom for a ranger character 0\n15 Minimum wisdom for a monk character +1\n16 Maximum wisdom for a half-orc character +2\n17 Maximum wisdom for a halfling characterMinimum wisdom for use of 6th level spells +3\n18 Minimum wisdom for use of 7th level spells +4\n19  +5\n\n†This adjustment applies to the saving throw of the character in question, the penalty for low wisdom, or the bonus for high wisdom, being used to alter the result of the die roll accordingly. The adjustment applies only to mental attack forms involving will force, e.g. beguiling, charming, fear, hypnosis, illusion, magic jarring, mass charming, phantasmal forces, possession, rulership, suggestion, telepathic attack, etc.\nWisdom Table II.: Adjustments for Clerics\n\nAbility Score Spell Bonus Chance of Spell Failure\n9 none 20%\n10 none 15%\n11 none 10%\n12 none 5%\n13 One 1st level 0%\n14 One 1st level 0%\n15 One 2nd level 0%\n16 One 2nd level 0%\n17 One 3rd level† 0%\n18 One 4th level‡ 0%\n19 One 5th level 0%\n\n†Minimum wisdom for use of 6th level spells\n‡Minimum wisdom for use of 7th level spells\nNotes regarding Wisdom Table II.\nSpell bonus indicates the number of additional spells the cleric is entitled to according to wisdom ability score.\nNote that these spells are only available when the cleric is entitled to spells of the applicable level.\nBonus spells are cumulative, so a cleric with 14 wisdom is entitled to two 1st level bonus spells, one with 15 wisdom has two 1st and one 2nd level bonus spells, etc.\nChance of Spell Failure states the percentage chance of failure clerics with low wisdom risk when casting spells.\nTo determine is a spell fails, percentile dice are rolled, and if the number generated is equal to or less than the number shown for failure, the spell is expended and has absolutely no effect whatsoever.\nDexterity\nDexterity encompasses a number of physical attributes including hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, precision, balance and speed of movement.\nDexterity is the major characteristic of the thief class of character, and it affects their professional activities (such as picking pockets, opening locks, and so forth) accordingly. Thieves with a dexterity ability score of 16 or more gain a bonus of 10% of earned experience.\nDexterity Table I.\n\nAbility Score General Information Reaction/Attacking Adjustment Defensive Adjustment\n3  -3 +4\n4  -2 +3\n5 Here or lower the character can only be a cleric -1 +2\n6 Minimum dexterity for a half-elf or mage character 0 +1\n7 Minimum dexterity for an elf character 0 0\n8 Minimum dexterity for a halfling character 0 0\n9 Minimum dexterity for a thief character 0 0\n10  0 0\n11  0 0\n12 Minimum dexterity for an assassin character 0 0\n13  0 0\n14  0 0\n15 Minimum dexterity for a monk character 0 -1\n16 Minimum dexterity for an illusionist character +1 -2\n17 Maximum dexterity for a dwarf character +2 -3\n18  +3 -4\n19  +4 -5\n\nNotes regarding Dexterity Table I.\nReaction/Attacking Adjustment is the penalty or bonus for both surprise situations and ‘to hit’ when performing missile combat attacks.\nDefensive Adjustment refers to the penalty or bonus applicable to a character’s saving throws against certain forms of attack (such as fire ball, lightning bolts, etc.) due to dodging ability. It also applies to the character’s parrying and/or dodging ability in missile or melee combat; in this case the penalty subtracts from the armour class of the character, making them easier to hit, while the bonus adds to the defensive value of the character’s armour class, making them harder to hit. Thus, a character with a baseline armour class of 2 with 3 dexterity has an armour class of 6 (2 + 4). However, if the same character has a dexterity of 18, their armour class would be -2 (2 – 4).\nDexterity Table II.: Adjustments for Thieves\n\nAbility Score Picking Pockets Spotting Traps\n9 -15% -10%\n10 -10% -10%\n11 -5% -5%\n12 0% 0%\n13 0% 0%\n14 0% 0%\n15 0% 0%\n16 0% 0%\n17 +5% 0%\n18 +10% +5%\n\nNotes regarding Dexterity Table II.\nPicking Pockets states the percentage adjustment to be made to the thief’s base chance of picking a chosen target’s pockets for a particular item.\nSpotting Traps states the percentage adjustment to be made to the thief’s base chance of passively spotting traps in a given room.\nMore information can be found in Character Classes, Thieves.\nConstitution\nConstitution is a term which encompasses the character’s physique, fitness, health, and resistance.\nConstitution scores above a certain number are necessary for becoming certain sub-classes of characters (paladins, rangers and monks).\nConstitution Table\n\nAbility Score General Information Hit Point Adjustment System Shock Survival Resurrection Survival\n3  -2 35% 40%\n4  -1 40% 45%\n5 Here or lower the character can only be an illusionist -1 45% 50%\n6 Minimum constitution for an elf or half-elf character -1 50% 55%\n7 Minimum constitution for a fighter character 0 55% 60%\n8 Minimum constitution for a gnome character 0 60% 65%\n9 Minimum constitution for a paladin character 0 65% 70%\n10 Minimum constitution for a halfling character 0 70% 75%\n11 Minimum constitution for a monk character 0 75% 80%\n12 Minimum constitution for a dwarf character 0 80% 85%\n13 Minimum constitution for a half-orc character 0 85% 90%\n14 Minimum constitution for a ranger character 0 88% 92%\n15  +1 91% 94%\n16  +2 95% 96%\n17  +2 (+3)† 97% 98%\n18  +2 (+4)† 99% 100%\n19  +2 (+5)† 100% 100%\n\n†Bonus applies only to fighters; all other classes may be given a maximum hit point bonus adjustment for constitution of +2.\nNotes regarding Constitution Table\nHit Point Adjustment indicates the subtraction from or addition to each hit die for a character. Note that subtraction can never reduce any hit die below 1, even if the roll is less than or equal to the hit point adjustment penalty. Note also that the only class of characters which is entitled to bonuses above +2 is fighters (including the fighter sub-classes assassins, paladins and rangers).\nSystem Shock Survival states the percentage chance the character has of surviving the following forms of magical attack (or simple application of magic): aging, petrification (including flesh to stone spell), polymorph any object, polymorph others. Two saving throws must be made when these effects are undergone: one to survive the spell, and a second (on success of the first) to determine if the spell takes effect (save failed) or if it is dispelled (save succeeded).\nResurrection Survival shows the percentage chance the character has of being successfully raised from the dead or resurrected by a cleric. The score of the percentile dice must be equal to or less than the number shown on the table, or the character fails to be revivified and is completely and totally dead forever.\nA character’s initial constitution is also the maximum number of times the character can be raised from the dead/resurrected, and that each such revivification reduces the character’s constitution score by 1.\nAlthough a character’s constitution score can be restored to its former score, or even raised above this number by magical means, this in no way alters the initial score limitation, nor does such magical change in constitution restore to the character additional chances for revivification.\nThus, if a character has an initial constitution of 15, they can never be brought back to life by a raise dead or resurrection spell more often than 15 times.\nCharisma\nCharisma is the measure of the character’s combined physical attractiveness, persuasiveness, and personal magnetism.\nCharisma scores above a certain number are necessary for becoming certain sub-classes of characters (druids and paladins).\nCharisma Table\n\nAbility Score General Information Maximum # of Henchmen†\n3  1\n4  1\n5 Here or lower the character can only be an assassin 2\n6  2\n7  3\n8 Minimum charisma for an elf character 3\n9  4\n10  4\n11  5\n12  5\n13  6\n14 Maximum charisma for a half-orc character 6\n15 Minimum charisma for a druid character 7\n16 Maximum charisma for a dwarf character 8\n17 Minimum charisma for a paladin character 10\n18  15\n\n†Refers to the number of non-player characters who will serve as permanent retainers of the player character.

However, this nature gives them a bonus with regard to their saving throws against attacks by magic wands, staves, rods and spells. This bonus is +1 for every 3½ points of constitution ability. Thus, if a dwarf had a constitution of 7 they would gain a +2 on dice rolls made as saving throws, at 14 constitution the bonus would be +4, and at 18 constitution the bonus would be the maximum normally possible, +5.\nSimilarly, dwarves have exceptional constitutional strength with regard to toxic substances, ingested or injected. Therefore, all dwarven characters make saving throws against poison in the same manner and with the same bonuses as they do against magical attacks from wands, staves, rods, and spells.\nAll dwarves are able to speak the following languages: dwarven, gnome, goblin, kobold, and orcish; in addition, dwarven characters are able to speak the “common tongue” of all humankind. However, they are unable to learn more than two additional languages regardless of their intelligence ability.\nDwarves are able to see radiation in the infra-red spectrum, so they can see up to 60’ in the dark noting varying degrees of heat radiation. This ability is known as “infravision.”\nDwarves are miners of great skill. They are able to detect the following facts when within 10’ or less of the particular phenomenon (except determination of approximate depth, which can be done at any distance):\n\nForm of Detection Chance of Success\nDetect grade or slope in passage, upwards or downwards 3 in 4\nDetect new construction or passage/tunnel 7 in 10\nDetect sliding or shifting walls or rooms 2 in 3\nDetect traps involving pits, falling blocks and other stonework 1 in 2\nDetermine approximate depth underground 1 in 2\n\nThis information is passively perceived thanks to years spent in training or as a child within dwarven mines.\nIt does not need to be actively rolled to determine.\nIn melee combat, dwarves add 1 to their dice rolls to hit opponents who are half-orcs, goblins, hobgoblins or orcs.\nWhen being attacked by ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, and/or titans, dwarves subtract 4 from their opponents’ ‘to hit’ dice rolls because of the dwarves’ small size and combat ability against these much bigger creatures.\nAs has already been noted, dwarven characters get a penalty of 1 on their charisma score due to racial characteristics.\nHowever, dwarven characters do not suffer charisma penalties nor are they limited to a 16 charisma maximum with regard to their own race.\nThus, a dwarf character may have additional dwarven henchmen up to their maximum before racial adjustments, but must obey a maximum number of non-dwarven henchmen up to their maximum after racial adjustments.\nElves\nElves can be clerics, fighters, rangers, mages, thieves, and assassins, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\nElven characters have a 90% resistance to sleep and charm spells (if these spells are cast upon them a percentile dice roll of 91% or better is required to allow the magic any chance of having an effect, and even then the saving throw against spells is allowed versus the charm spell).\nWhen employing either a bow of any sort other than a crossbow, or a short or long sword, elven characters gain a bonus of +1 on their die rolls ‘to hit.’\nAll elven characters are able to speak the following languages: elvish, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orcish, gnoll and the “common tongue” of mankind. Elven characters of above 15 intelligence are able to learn one additional language for every point of language above 15, i.e. a character with an 18 intelligence could learn three additional languages.\nElves have the ability to see into the infra-red spectrum, so they are able to see up to 60’ in darkness, noting varying degrees of heat radiation.\nSecret or concealed doors are difficult to hide from elves. Elves have a 1 in 6 chance of noticing the latter when passing within 10’. If actively searching for such doors, elven characters have a 2 in 6 chance to find a secret door and a 3 in 6 chance to discover a concealed portal.\nIf alone and not in metal armour (or if well in advance – 90’ or more – of a party which does not consist entirely of elves and/or halflings) an elven character moves so silently that they will surprise monsters on a 4 in 6 chance unless some portal must be opened in order to confront the monster. In the latter case the chance for surprise drops to a 2 in 6 chance.\nGnomes\nGnomes can be clerics, fighters, illusionists, thieves, and assassins, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\nSimilar to their cousins, the dwarves, gnomes are highly resistant to magic. A gnome player character gains a bonus with regard to their saving throws against attacks by magic wands, staves, rods and spells. This bonus is +1 for every 3½ points of constitution ability, the same as for dwarven characters.\nGnome characters are able to speak the following languages in addition to the “common tongue” of humanity: dwarvish, gnome, halfling, goblin, kobold, and they can also communicate with any burrowing mammal (such as moles, badgers, ground squirrels, etc.). Gnomes are unable to learn more than two languages in addition to those noted above, regardless of how high their intelligence score is.\nGnomes have infravision, the ability to see into the infra-red spectrum, so a gnome character is able to see up to 60’ in the dark, noting varying heat radiation.\nBeing miners of exceptional merit, gnomes are able to detect the following facts when within 10’ of the area to be examined, or at any distance with respect to determination of their approximate depth underground:\n\nForm of Detection Chance of Success\nDetect grade or slope in passage, upwards or downwards 4 in 5\nDetect unsafe walls, ceilings, or floors 7 in 10\nDetermine approximate depth underground 3 in 5\nDetermine direction of travel underground 1 in 2\n\nThis information is passively perceived thanks to years spent in training or as a child within gnome mines. It does not need to be actively rolled to determine.\nIn melee combat, gnome characters add 1 to their dice rolls to hit opponents who are kobolds or goblins. When being attacked by gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants and/or titans, gnome characters subtract 4 from their opponents’ ‘to hit’ dice rolls because of the gnomes’ small size and their combat skill against these much bigger creatures.\nHalf-elves\nHalf-elves can be clerics, druids, fighters, rangers, mages, thieves, assassins and bards, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\nHalf-elven characters have a 30% resistance to sleep and charm spells (if these spells are cast upon them a percentile dice roll of 31% or better is required to allow the magic any chance of having an effect, and even then the saving throw against spells is allowed versus the charm spell).\nAll half-elven characters are able to speak the “common tongue” of men and the following languages: elvish, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orcish and gnoll. Half-elven characters of above 16 intelligence are able to learn one additional language for every point of language above 16, i.e. a character with an 18 intelligence could learn two additional languages.\nHalf-elves have the ability to see into the infra-red spectrum, so they are able to see up to 60’ in darkness, noting varying degrees of heat radiation.\nSecret or concealed doors are difficult to hide from half-elves, just as they are noticeable for elves. Half-elves have a 1 in 6 chance of noticing the latter when passing within 10’. If actively searching for such doors, half-elven characters have a 2 in 6 chance to find a secret door and a 3 in 6 chance to discover a concealed portal.\nHalflings\nHalflings can be clerics, druids, fighters and thieves, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\nAll halfling characters have a high resistance to magic spells, so for every 3½ points of constitution ability the character possesses, they gain a +1 on saving throws versus wands, staves, rods, and spells, as with dwarves and gnomes.\nAs halflings also have a similar resistance to poisons of all sorts, they gain a constitution bonus identical to that for saving throws versus magical attacks when they make saving throws versus poison.\nAll halflings characters are able to speak the following languages in addition to mankind’s “common tongue”: dwarvish, elvish, gnome, goblin, halfling, and orcish. Halflings with intelligence above 16 can learn one additional language for every point of language above 16, i.e. a character with an 18 intelligence could learn two additional languages.\nCertain halfling characters have infravision. Those with mixed blood are assumed to have infravision which functions up to 30’ distant, while those of pure Stoutish blood are able to see heat radiation variation at up to 60’ (normal infravision).\nSimilarly, halflings of mixed type and those of pure Stoutish blood are able to note if a passage is an up or down grade 75% of the time, and they can determine direction 50% of the time. Note that this information is passively perceived thanks to years spent in training or as a child within halfling mines. It does not need to be actively rolled to determine.\nIf alone (or well in advance – 90’ or more – of a party which does not consist entirely of elves and/or halflings) and not in metal armour, a halfling character moves so silently that they will surprise monsters on a 4 in 6 chance unless some portal must be opened in order to confront the monster. In the latter case the chance for surprise drops to a 2 in 6 chance.\nHalf-orcs\nHalf-orcs can be clerics, fighters, thieves and assassins, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\nHalf-orc characters are able to speak the “common tongue” of humanity and orcish as well. These characters are able to learn a maximum of two additional languages.\nHalf-orcs have infravision, so that they can detect varying degrees of heat radiation up to 60’ distant in the dark.\nAlthough half-orcs subtract 2 from their charisma, this penalty is in regard to non-half-orc non-player character henchmen only, so the initial, unaltered, charisma ability score should be recorded for purposes of recruiting half-orc non-player character henchmen.\nHumans\nHumans can be clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, rangers, mages, illusionists, thieves, assassins, monks and bards, or any multi-classed combination of these races.\n","id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/characters/races/","title":"Races"},"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/skills/animal-friendship/":{"id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/skills/animal-friendship/","title":"Animal Friendship","body":"Animal Friendship\nAnimal friendship is the ability to tame animals as companions in battle and on adventures, to a far greater extent than mere domestic pets or livestock.\nDruids and rangers can study animal friendship.\nAnimal Friends\nOnce the character has reached an expert understanding of this skill, they may call for \"animal friends\".\nThe character will be referred to as the \"Sire\" of the animals.\nThis will be one or two animal creatures that, once called, will attach themselves to the Sire in a manner similar to henchmen.\nThese animals will be wholly loyal and will be 'run' by the player - but they will be subject to morale checks like followers.\nMoreover, because animal friends are not as intelligent as most henchmen, there are limitations as to what actions they can take.\nIntelligence\nAnimal friends will conform to four levels of intelligence, consistent with their having 1 to 4 intelligence points ('animal' or 'semi-intelligence').\nThe smarter the animal, the greater the animal's versatility.\nA complete list of animals and their intelligence can be found here.\nNote that all animals of any level of intelligence will come when called and show affection to the Sire.\n"},"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/places/world/":{"id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/places/world/","body":"World\nThis page provides details about my D&amp;D world as reference for myself and my players.\nEssentially, the game world is Earth 1650, but along a timeline where there is magic, the manifestation of powerful, chaotic energy from other dimensions;

is the practice of healing and restoring the body from injury or disease.\nClerics and druids can study medicine.\nUnskilled Medicine\nUnskilled medics can aid rest.\nAid Rest\nAllows a character to assist another in resting.\nFor every point of knowledge the character has, they may attend to one resting creature.\nEach creature attended heals while resting as though two levels or hit dice (if unlevelled) higher, essentially providing an additional 2 h.p. of healing per day.\nNote that characters who are aiding rest cannot rest themselves.\nAmateur Medicine\nAmateurs can practice diagnosis and wound care.\nDiagnosis\nAllows a character to identify a disease or poison affecting a patient.\nIf the character suspects the patient may be suffering from a disease or poison, they may roll vs. medicine.\nOn success, the character performs a correct diagnosis and is granted knowledge of what area of the body is being affected, the extent of damage or loss of attributes likely to occur and the chance that the condition is terminal.\nFor terminal cases, the character can make an estimate of the time left to the patient, but of course cannot name the exact length of time the character has left.\nTake note that this diagnosis can include correctly describing ailments resulting from magical or supernatural causes.\nOn failure, the character is deemed not to uncover the source of the ailment.\nAs the character rolls their own die for success, misdiagnosis is not considered.\nWound Binding\nAllows a character to bind wounds using bandages more quickly or more effectively than others.\nThe character has the choice of a quick binding or a careful binding.\nQuick Binding\nThe time to bind a wound is 2 rounds, +1 round per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.\nHence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 3 rounds to bind.\nCareful Binding\nThe binding must be done with clean bandages.\nThe time to bind a wound is 3 rounds, +2 rounds per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.\nHence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 5 rounds to bind.\nIf the character completes the binding without interruption, they can restore 1 hit point of damage received before binding began.\nAuthority Medicine\nAuthorities can treat different ailments: they may perform amputations, disease treatments, detoxification, and may set injuries.\n"},"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/combat/wounds/":{"body":"Wounds\nWhen 11 or more damage results from a single physical attack, the damaged creature is said to be wounded.\nIn future rounds, until the wound is managed, the character will 'bleed' hit points each round.\nThe severity of the wound is based on the damage received.\nFor every 11 points of damage, the wound will drain the character of 1 h.p.\nThus, a 22 damage attack would cause a 2 h.p. wound; a 43 damage attack would cause a 3 h.p. wound.\nCharacters may receive multiple wounds at once; the wounds are counted cumulatively.\nCreatures which are not composed of flesh, regenerative creatures, manifestations (demons, devils and the undead), jellies, gasses and golems all cannot be wounded.\nWound damage is not counted towards stunning nor does it affect a spellcaster's concentration.\nManaging Wounds\nThere are several techniques which will close wounds.\n\nThe close wound cantrip can close one wound.\nEating a goodberry will close one wound per berry.\nA healing salve poured into a wound will close one wound per point of healing.\nHealing spells of any kind, including a paladin's lay on hands, will close all wounds.\nWounds may also be physically bound with bandages.\n\nBinding Wounds\nTo bind a wound, a creature must possess at least a low intelligence.\nBinding a wound takes 3 rounds, +2 rounds per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.\nHence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 5 rounds to bind.\nNote that characters trained in medicine may bind wounds in less time.\nEach wound must be bound individually.\nWhile binding is taking place, the creature will cease to take damage from the wound.\nIf the binding of a wound is interrupted, the wound will reopen and the binding must be started again from the beginning.\nBandages\nBandages can be made from any light, loose cloth material on the character's person or nearby.\nThese bandages are considered 'improper dressings'.\nActual bandages may be purchased at a market, and are considered to be clean, unless damaged by water, fire or another condition.\nThese bandages are considered 'proper dressings'.\nImproper dressings, being partly soiled, have a chance of causing an infection or disease.\nThe chance of a random disease occurring when an improper dressing is left alone is 1 in 30.\nThe chance of a disease occurring if an improper dressing is removed within an hour and not replaced with a proper dressing, and the wound is left open to the air, is 1 in 20.\n","title":"Wounds","id":"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/combat/wounds/"},"https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/skills/acrobatics/":{"body":"Acrobatics\nAcrobatics is
