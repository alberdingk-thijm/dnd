# World

This page provides details about my D&D world as reference for myself and my players.
Essentially, the game world is Earth 1650, but along a timeline where there is magic, the manifestation of powerful, chaotic energy from other dimensions; fantastical creatures and monsters; and a few other simplifying assumptions to help make the world easier to administer from a *game* perspective.

## People

Some important people in my game world, based on the goings-on of the period and the areas the players have visited:
