# Mage

Often occupying important political and social positions, mages are those who can control the incredible force of magic.
Though their powers are difficult for even them to understand, mages possess an impressive gift in manipulating the energies of the universe using their bodies and voices.
This skill is developed through rigorous mental training and practice in reading and casting magic spells.
Thus, even though they are fragile combatants, mages hold the key to using the widest variety of magic available to any mortals, limited only by their own magical talent.

## Ability Scores

Mages' primary attribute is **intelligence**.

Mages must have an intelligence of 9 or higher and a dexterity of 6 or higher.
Multi-classed mages must have an intelligence of 13 or higher.
Mages with an intelligence of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to earned experience.

Mages make good use of a high dexterity and constitution for purposes of surviving combat.

## Combat

Mages use **4-sided hit dice**.

Mages cannot wear any armour and may use only the simplest weapons: *daggers*, *darts* and *staffs*.
Mages begin with **one weapon proficiency** and take a -5 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.

A new weapon proficiency is gained for every six levels above the first.

Mages can use virtually any magic items.

## Skills

Under normal circumstances, mages are able to **read**.

Skills available to mages include:
* [alchemy](./wiki/skills/alchemy.md)
* [architecture](./wiki/skills/architecture.md)
* [astrology & astronomy](./wiki/skills/astrology.md)

* **geology**
* **history**
* **law**
* **linguistics**
* **mercantilism**
* **philosophy**

At first level, mages gain 8 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.

Mages gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.

375,000 experience points are required for each additional level above 18th.

Mages gain 1 h.p. per level above 11th.

## Spell Acquisition & Use

### Spellbooks

As a means to concentrate on and study magic, mages may store the symbols and words of their cantrips and spells in books or scrolls.
The series of symbols and words is known as the 'incantation' of a spell, which must be studied in order for the magic to follow the mage's whim.
More powerful spells require longer incantations, which are measured in 'quires'.
The standard length of one quire is sixteen nine-by-twelve inch pages.
As books can vary in size, the quire provides a simple unit for recording incantation size.

A single cantrip requires 1/32 of a quire.

A given spell level requires 1/16 of a quire by level, i.e. a fifth level spell requires 5/16 of a quire.

Once a book or scroll is filled, the mage must acquire a new book or scroll to write in future spells.
When new spells are acquired, it is presumed that the mage is able to hold them in memory until such time as they can be transcribed in a spellbook.

### Spell Recovery

Once a cantrip or spell has been cast, the mage must study the cantrip or spell again in their spellbook after a period of overnight rest (typically six hours).

<tr><th>Cantrip Type</th> <th>Number Gained at First Level</th> <th>Roll</th></tr>
<tr><td>Haunting sound</td> <td>1d3</td> <td>01&ndash;13</td></tr>

#### Notes on Mage Spell Table I.

*Number Gained at First Level* states the number of cantrips acquired at first level.

Each subsequent cantrip after first level may be chosen by rolling a percentile die to determine the cantrip type (per the *Roll* column) and then choosing a cantrip within that group.
