# Illusionist

Illusionists, like their super-class the mage, focus on manipulating magical energies rather than defeating foes in combat.
Unlike mages, however, illusionists specialize in assaulting the targetâ€™s cognition and vision, leading their enemies to believe mirages and ignore the truth.
To be able to use such powerful magic, they must study far longer than most mages, often under the tutelage of an alchemist, scribe or other learned figure.
Driven by the accumulation of knowledge, powerful illusionists may live their entire existence within illusions that are themselves part of greater illusions.

## Ability Scores

Illusionists' primary attribute is **intelligence**.

Illusionists must have an intelligence of 15 or higher and a dexterity of 16 or higher.
Multi-classed illusionists must have an intelligence of 16 or higher.
Illusionists do not gain any experience bonuses.

Illusionists benefit from a high constitution for surviving combat.

## Combat

Illusionists use **4-sided hit dice**.

Illusionists cannot wear any armour and may use only basic weapons: *clubs*, *daggers*, *darts* and *quarterstaffs*.
Illusionists begin with **one weapon proficiency** and take a -5 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.

A new weapon proficiency is gained for every six levels above the first.

Illusionists can use virtually any magic items.

## Spell Acquisition & Use

### Spellbooks

As a means to concentrate on and study magic, illusionists may store the symbols and words of their cantrips and spells in books or scrolls.
The series of symbols and words is known as the 'incantation' of a spell, which must be studied in order for the magic to follow the illusionist's whim.
More powerful spells require longer incantations, which are measured in 'quires'.
The standard length of one quire is sixteen nine-by-twelve inch pages.
As books can vary in size, the quire provides a simple unit for recording incantation size.

A single cantrip requires 1/32 of a quire.

A given spell level requires 1/16 of a quire by level, i.e. a fifth level spell requires 5/16 of a quire.

Once a book or scroll is filled, the illusionist must acquire a new book or scroll to write in future spells.
When new spells are acquired, it is presumed that the illusionist is able to hold them in memory until such time as they can be transcribed in a spellbook.

### Spell Recovery

Once a cantrip or spell has been cast, the illusionist must study the cantrip or spell again in their spellbook after a period of overnight rest (typically six hours).

#### Notes on Illusionist Spell Table I.

*Number Gained at First Level* states the number of cantrips acquired at first level.

Each subsequent cantrip after first level may be chosen by rolling a percentile die to determine the cantrip type (per the *Roll* column) and then choosing a cantrip within that group.
