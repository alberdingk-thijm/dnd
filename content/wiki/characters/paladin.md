# Paladin

Paladins are a sub-class of fighters who follow a religious bent.
A paladin’s martial skill makes them a valuable weapon in the hand of their god, and the religious virtue which they symbolically – and perchance actually – represent can lead to a communal renown on par with that of a compassionate cleric leader.

## Ability Scores

Paladins' primary attribute is **strength**.

Paladins must have a strength of 12 or higher, an intelligence of 9 or higher, a wisdom of 13 or higher, a constitution of 9 or higher and a charisma of 17 or higher.
Multi-classed paladins must have a strength of 15 or higher and a wisdom of 15 or higher.
Paladins with a strength of 16 or higher and a wisdom of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to earned experience.

Paladins are entitled to exceptional strength and to constitution bonuses.
A paladin with an 18 strength is able to roll a d100 for exceptional strength and consult the [strength table](./wiki/characters/ability-scores.md#strength-table-ii-ability-adjustments) for additional bonuses.
For purposes of reducing or increasing a paladin's strength score, each percentile bracket counts as an additional point of strength: hence, a paladin with an 18/66 strength would become a paladin with an 18/01 strength upon losing one point of strength, or a paladin with an 18/76 strength upon gaining a point of strength (the exact percentile is irrelevant).

Paladins with 17 constitution receive +3 hit points on each hit die.
Paladins with 18 constitution receive +4 hit points on each hit die.

As close quarters fighters, paladin benefit from a high constitution.

## Combat

Paladins use **10-sided hit dice**.

Paladins may use any form of weapon or armour.

Paladins begin with **three weapon proficiencies** and take a -2 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.
A new weapon proficiency is gained for every three levels above the first.

Paladins can employ many magical items, including potions, protection scrolls, many rings and other magic items; and all forms of armour, shields and weapons.

Paladins gain a +2 bonus to all **saving throws**.

As they advance in level, paladins gain the ability to make multiple attacks per round.
The progression of this ability is as follows:

<table>
<tr><th>Level</th> <th># Attacks/Round</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>

Hence, a 5th level paladin can attack once a round for three rounds and twice in the fourth round.

Once reaching fifth level, paladins' attacks are all considered to cost 1 AP.
Note that they can still only perform the given number of attacks per round, regardless of AP cost.

## Skills

Paladins are not inherently **literate**.

All paladins are immune to all forms of disease and have the ability to **cure disease**.

All paladins have the ability to **lay on hands**.

All paladins emanate a 1-hex (5') aura of **protection from malevolence**.

Skills available to paladins include **athletics**, **discipline**, **dog training**, **falconry**, **heraldry**, **logistics**, **necromancy**, **organization**, **perception**, **puissance**, **riding**, **theology** and **unarmed combat**.

At first level, paladins gain 6 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.
Paladins gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.

<tr><th>Level</th><th>Min. XP</th><th>HD</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2,751</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>5,501</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>12,001</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>700,001</td><td>9+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>1,050,001</td><td>9+6</td></tr>
</table>

350,000 experience points are required for each additional level above 11th.

Paladins gain 3 h.p. per level above 9th.

## Spell Acquisition & Use

At 9th level, paladins gain the ability to employ cleric spells.

Paladins do not gain bonus spells based on their **wisdom**, and may never use scrolls of spells except those normally used by fighters.

### Spell Recovery

Like clerics, paladins must rest overnight and pray before recovering their spells.
