# Assassin

Assassins are, most simply, killers.
They may use poison, traps or weapons to accomplish their goals.
Like thieves, they may live on the dark periphery of society, avoiding contact with the law.
They are more accomplished in combat than thieves, however, and can also don disguises and spy on their targets.
Assassins are considered a subclass of fighters, and hence gain strength and constitution bonuses as fighters do.

## Ability Scores

Assassins' primary attribute is **strength**.

Assassins must have a strength of 12 or higher, an intelligence of 11 or higher, and a dexterity of 12 or higher.
Multi-classed assassins must have a dexterity of 15 or higher.
Assassins do not receive experience point bonuses.

Assassins are entitled to exceptional strength and to constitution bonuses.
An assassin with an 18 strength is able to roll a d100 for exceptional strength and consult the [strength table](./wiki/characters/ability-scores.md#strength-table-ii-ability-adjustments) for additional bonuses.
For purposes of reducing or increasing an assassin's strength score, each percentile bracket counts as an additional point of strength: hence, an assassin with an 18/66 strength would become an assassin with an 18/01 strength upon losing one point of strength, or an assassin with an 18/76 strength upon gaining a point of strength (the exact percentile is irrelevant).

As close quarters fighters, assassins benefit from a high constitution.

## Combat

Assassins use **8-sided hit dice**.

Assassins may wear *padded*, *leather* or *studded leather* armour, including *shields* but not *great helmets*.
Assassins may use any sort of weapon.

Assassins begin with **three weapon proficiencies** and take a -2 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.

A new weapon proficiency is gained for every four levels above the first.

Assassins may use any magic items available to **fighters**, barring items corresponding to armours they may not normally wear.

## Skills

Assassins are not inherently **literate**.

All assassins have the ability to **assassinate** an enemy.

Skills available to assassins include **anatomy**, **athletics**, **backstabbing**, **camelback riding**, **dog training**, **falconry**, **flying mounts**, **guile**, **horseback riding**, **interrogation**, **lockpicking**, **perception**, **poisoning**, **stealth**, **subterfuge**, **traps** and **unarmed combat**.

At first level, assassins gain 6 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.
Assassins gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.


## Experience Table

Assassins are limited to 15 levels.
