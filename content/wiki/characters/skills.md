# Skills

A large set of secondary skills available to player characters depending on character class.
As characters advance in level and skill **knowledge**, they gain access to additional abilities.
Skills cover virtually all forms of knowledge in the game outside of class abilities.

Knowledge governs how familiar a character is with a given skill.
A character's knowledge is represented as a number out of 20.

Characters with no points of knowledge in a skill are *untrained* in the skill.
Characters with 1 or 2 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *unskilled*, able to perform perhaps the most basic techniques of a skill.
Characters with at least 3 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *amateurs* with basic training in the skill.
Characters with at least 7 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *authorities* with richer understanding of the skill.
Characters with at least 13 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *experts*.
Characters with 20 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *masters* of the skill.

The number of points of knowledge a character earns upon levelling depends on their **intelligence** and their class.
