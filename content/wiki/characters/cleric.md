# Cleric

Clerics are religious leaders in service of some deity.
While each religion is different, all clerics perform religious ceremonies and are studied in the doctrine of their religion.
Clerics are connected to an organized church and act as leaders in the community, helping their fellows reach spiritual enlightenment.
Typically, they represent a link between the commoner – who cannot know the will of the gods – and the gods themselves, with whom the cleric communicates.
They manifest magical powers which are typically ascribed to the will of their god(s) and which are acquired through prayer.
These powers may help or harm: nonetheless, clerics are well-regarded for their healing abilities.
They are also capable in combat and can engage their foes armoured and armed.

## Ability Scores

Clerics' primary attribute is **wisdom**.
Clerics must have a wisdom of 9 or higher.
Multi-classed clerics must have a wisdom of 13 or higher.
Clerics with a wisdom of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to earned experience.

Clerics are capable combatants; high strength and constitution scores are also desirable.

## Combat

Clerics use **8-sided hit dice**.

Clerics may use all forms of weapons and armour.
Certain religions may, however, restrict clerics to using certain prescribed implements exclusively.
Clerics begin with **two weapon proficiencies** and take a -3 penalty “to hit” when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.

A new weapon proficiency is gained for every four levels above the first.

Clerics can employ a fair number of magic items including most potions; clerical and “protection” scrolls; most rings; some wands, rods and staves; many other magical items; and all magical weaponry and magical armour.

## Skills

Under normal circumstances, clerics are able to **read**.

Clerics are not trained in **riding**.

Skills available to clerics include **turn undead**, **medicine**, **law**, **history**, **politics**, **religious art & music**, **religious architecture**, **folklore**, **astronomy & astrology**, **rituals** and **heraldry**.
