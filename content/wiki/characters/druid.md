# Druid

Druids are spiritualists of the natural world, adhering to the philosophy that the contemplation of the natural world is the highest state of being.
They are not part of any religious organization: they may decide individually how nature should be preserved or ordered.
Druids manifest magical powers, like clerics, but these powers are attributed to the forces of the natural world which druids have mastered for centuries.

## Ability Scores

Druids' primary attribute is **wisdom**.
Druids must have a wisdom of 12 or higher and a charisma of 15 or higher.
Multi-classed druids must have a wisdom of 13 or higher.
Druids with a wisdom and charisma of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to earned experience.

Druids do well with a high dexterity and constitution for combat purposes; a good strength is likewise of benefit.

## Combat

Druids use **8-sided hit dice**.

Druids may not use metal armours as they inhibit their magical abilities.
As such they are limited to *leather*, *wood* or *turtle-shell* (equivalent to scale mail) armours.
Druids can use *clubs*, *daggers*, *darts*, *hammers*, *scimitars*, *slings*, *spears* and *staffs*.
Druids begin with **two weapon proficiencies** and take a -4 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.

A new weapon proficiency is gained for every five levels above the first.

Druids can employ all magical items available to every class and those non-written magic items which are available to clerics.

All druids gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against *fire* and *lightning* attacks.


## Skills

Druids are not inherently **literate**.

Druids are not trained in **riding**.

Skills available to druids include **shapeshifting**, **nature languages**, **animal friendship**, **geology**, **oceanography**, **animal biology**, **botany**, **astronomy**, **golemancy**, **alchemy** and **geography**.

## Experience Table
