# Ranger

Rangers are a sub-class of rangers who are adept at woodcraft, tracking, scouting, and infiltration and spying.
Rangers may live in frontier communities or out in the wilds, travelling the region in search of danger.

## Ability Scores

Rangers' primary attribute is **strength**.

Rangers must have a strength of 13 or higher, an intelligence of 13 or higher, a wisdom of 14 or higher and a constitution of 14 or higher.
Multi-classed rangers must have a strength of 15 or higher, an intelligence of 15 or higher and a wisdom of 15 or higher.
Rangers with a strength of 16 or higher, an intelligence of 16 or higher and a wisdom of 16 or higher gain a 10% bonus to earned experience.

Rangers are entitled to exceptional strength and to constitution bonuses.
A ranger with an 18 strength is able to roll a d100 for exceptional strength and consult the [strength table](./wiki/characters/ability-scores.md#strength-table-ii-ability-adjustments) for additional bonuses.
For purposes of reducing or increasing a ranger's strength score, each percentile bracket counts as an additional point of strength: hence, a ranger with an 18/66 strength would become a ranger with an 18/01 strength upon losing one point of strength, or a ranger with an 18/76 strength upon gaining a point of strength (the exact percentile is irrelevant).

Rangers with 17 constitution receive +3 hit points on each hit die.
Rangers with 18 constitution receive +4 hit points on each hit die.

## Combat

Rangers use **8-sided hit dice**.
At first level, they have **two 8-sided hit dice**.

Rangers may use any form of weapon or armour.

Rangers begin with **three weapon proficiencies** and take a -2 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.
A new weapon proficiency is gained for every three levels above the first.

Rangers can employ many magical items, including potions, protection scrolls, many rings and other magic items; and all forms of armour, shields and weapons.
Rangers of tenth level or higher may use all non-written magic items which pertain to **clairaudience**, **clairvoyance**, **ESP** and **telepathy**.

As they advance in level, rangers gain the ability to make multiple attacks per round.
The progression of this ability is as follows:

<table>
<tr><th>Level</th> <th># Attacks/Round</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>

Hence, a 5th level ranger can attack once a round for three rounds and twice in the fourth round.

Once reaching fifth level, rangers' attacks are all considered to cost 1 AP.
Note that they can still only perform the given number of attacks per round, regardless of AP cost.

## Skills

* **animal friendship**

* **geography**

* **oceanography**
* **perception**

* **scouting**

At first level, rangers gain 6 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.
At first level, rangers gain 2 knowledge points in **hunting** and **scouting**.

Rangers gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.

</table>

325,000 experience points are required for each additional level above 11th.

Rangers gain 3 h.p. per level above 11th.

## Spell Acquisition & Use

At 8th level, rangers gain the ability to employ druid spells.

At 9th level, rangers gain the ability to employ mage spells.

Rangers do not gain bonus spells based on their **wisdom**, but must roll against **intelligence** to determine which spells they can learn like a mage.
They may never use scrolls of spells except those normally used by fighters.

### Spell Recovery

Like mages, rangers must rest overnight and study from a **spellbook** before recovering their spells.
