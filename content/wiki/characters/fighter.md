# Fighter

Fighters are the traditional soldiery of the world: they are among the strongest and most resilient of combatants.
They may follow any goal or organization they choose.
Fighters do not use magical spells but instead focus on the improvement of their combat technique.

## Ability Scores

Fighters' primary attribute is **strength**.

Fighters must have a strength of 9 or higher and a constitution of 7 or higher.
Multi-classed fighters must have a strength of 13 or higher.
Fighters with a strength of 16 or higher gain a 10% experience bonus.

Fighters are entitled to exceptional strength and to constitution bonuses.
A fighter with an 18 strength is able to roll a d100 for exceptional strength and consult the [strength table](./wiki/characters/ability-scores.md#strength-table-ii-ability-adjustments) for additional bonuses.
For purposes of reducing or increasing a fighter's strength score, each percentile bracket counts as an additional point of strength: hence, a fighter with an 18/66 strength would become a fighter with an 18/01 strength upon losing one point of strength, or a fighter with an 18/76 strength upon gaining a point of strength (the exact percentile is irrelevant).

Fighters with 17 constitution receive +3 hit points on each hit die.
Fighters with 18 constitution receive +4 hit points on each hit die.

Fighters benefit from high constitution and dexterity scores.

## Combat

Fighters use **10-sided hit dice**.

Fighters may use any form of weapon or armour.

Fighters begin with **four weapon proficiencies** and take a -2 penalty "to hit" when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.
A new weapon proficiency is gained for every three levels above the first.

Fighters can employ many magical items, including potions, protection scrolls, many rings and other magic items; and all forms of armour, shields and weapons.

As they advance in level, fighters gain the ability to make multiple attacks per round.
The progression of this ability is as follows:

<table>
<tr><th>Level</th> <th># Attacks/Round</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5/4</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>4/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>3/2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>5/3</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>

Hence, a 5th level fighter can attack once a round for three rounds and twice in the fourth round.

Once reaching fourth level, fighters' attacks are all considered to cost 1 AP.
Note that they can still only perform the given number of attacks per round, regardless of AP cost.
