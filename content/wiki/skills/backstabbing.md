# Backstabbing

Backstabbing is the art of combat against surprised foes.
In such contexts, a combatant trained in backstabbing can perform much more damaging strikes.

[Assassins](./wiki/characters/assassin.md) and [thieves](./wiki/characters/thief.md) can study backstabbing.

## Unskilled Backstabbing

Unskilled thieves (but *not assassins*) gain +2 to hit against surprised foes and deal double damage with their attacks when backstabbing.

## Amateur Backstabbing

Amateurs gain +4 to hit against surprised foes and deal double damage with their attacks when backstabbing.

Amateurs may only perform a backstabbing attack with a *knife*, *dagger*, *short sword* or *hand-axe*.

## Authority Backstabbing

Authorities deal triple damage with their attacks when backstabbing.

Authorities may also perform a backstabbing attack with a *scimitar*, *spear*, *dirk* or *long sword*, provided they are able to use such a weapon.
