# Medicine

Medicine is the practice of healing and restoring the body from injury or disease.

[Clerics](./wiki/characters/cleric.md) and [druids](./wiki/characters/druid.md) can study medicine.

## Unskilled Medicine

Unskilled medics can *aid rest*.

### Aid Rest

Allows a character to assist another in resting.

For every point of knowledge the character has, they may attend to one resting creature.

Each creature attended heals while resting as though two levels or hit dice (if unlevelled) higher, essentially providing an additional 2 h.p. of healing per day.

Note that characters who are aiding rest cannot rest themselves.

## Amateur Medicine

Amateurs can practice *diagnosis* and *wound care*.

### Diagnosis

Allows a character to identify a disease or poison affecting a patient.
If the character suspects the patient may be suffering from a disease or poison, they may **roll vs. medicine**.

On success, the character performs a correct diagnosis and is granted knowledge of what area of the body is being affected, the extent of damage or loss of attributes likely to occur and the chance that the condition is terminal.
For terminal cases, the character can make an estimate of the time left to the patient, but of course cannot name the exact length of time the character has left.
Take note that this diagnosis can include correctly describing ailments resulting from magical or supernatural causes.

On failure, the character is deemed not to uncover the source of the ailment.
As the character rolls their own die for success, misdiagnosis is not considered.

### Wound Binding

Allows a character to [bind wounds using bandages](./wiki/combat/wounds.md#binding-wounds) more quickly or more effectively than others.
The character has the choice of a *quick binding* or a *careful binding*.

#### Quick Binding

The time to bind a wound is 2 rounds, +1 round per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.
Hence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 3 rounds to bind.

#### Careful Binding

The binding must be done with clean bandages.

The time to bind a wound is 3 rounds, +2 rounds per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.
Hence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 5 rounds to bind.

If the character completes the binding without interruption, they can restore 1 hit point of damage received before binding began.

## Authority Medicine

Authorities can treat different ailments: they may perform *amputations*, *disease treatments*, *detoxification*, and may *set injuries*.
