# Folklore

Folklore is the collection of folk traditions, myths and legends of a region.
It encompasses a rich oral tradition of poems, epics, songs and other artistic works.

Folklore is a *modal* skill: folklorists must choose a **world region** to study when investing knowledge points.
Folklore knowledge points provide halved bonuses for regions outside of a folklorist's specialty.

[Bards](./wiki/characters/bard.md), [clerics](./wiki/characters/cleric.md), [druids](./wiki/characters/druid.md), [monks](./wiki/characters/monk.md) and [rangers](./wiki/characters/ranger.md) can study folklore.
