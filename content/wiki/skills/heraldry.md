# Heraldry

Heraldry is the study of crests, sigils, coats of arms and other such markers used to denote status and distinction.

Heraldry is a *modal* skill: heraldry students must choose a **world region** to study when investing knowledge points.
Heraldry knowledge points provide halved bonuses for regions outside of a heraldry student's specialty.
