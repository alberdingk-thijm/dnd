# Animal Friendship

Animal friendship is the ability to tame animals as companions in battle and on adventures, to a far greater extent than mere domestic pets or livestock.

[Druids](./wiki/characters/druid.md) and [rangers](./wiki/characters/ranger.md) can study animal friendship.

## Animal Friends

Once the character has reached an *expert* understanding of this skill, they may call for "animal friends".
The character will be referred to as the "Sire" of the animals.

This will be one or two animal creatures that, once called, will attach themselves to the Sire in a manner similar to henchmen.
These animals will be wholly loyal and will be 'run' by the player - but they will be subject to morale checks like followers.
Moreover, because animal friends are not as intelligent as most henchmen, there are limitations as to what actions they can take.

### Intelligence

Animal friends will conform to four levels of intelligence, consistent with their having 1 to 4 intelligence points ('animal' or 'semi-intelligence').
The smarter the animal, the greater the animal's versatility.
A complete list of animals and their intelligence can be found [here](tao-dndwiki.blogspot.com/2018/02/animal-friends.html).
Note that all animals of any level of intelligence will come when called and show affection to the Sire.
