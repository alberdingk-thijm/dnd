# Architecture

Architecture is the study of planning, designing and constructing buildings and other structures.
Architects study how to design structures to be stronger, more impressive or more aesthetically pleasing.
Architecture overlaps with engineering, mathematics and art.

[Bards](./wiki/characters/bard.md) who specialize in architecture are understood to naturally gain architecture abilities as they level, without spending knowledge points.

[Mages](./wiki/characters/mage.md) and [illusionists](./wiki/characters/illusionist.md) can study architecture.
