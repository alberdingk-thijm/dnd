# Skills

A large set of secondary skills available to player characters depending on character class.
As characters advance in level and skill **knowledge**, they gain access to additional abilities.
Skills cover virtually all forms of knowledge in the game outside of class abilities.

Knowledge governs how familiar a character is with a given skill.
A character's knowledge is represented as a number out of 20.

Characters with no points of knowledge in a skill are *untrained* in the skill.
Characters with 1 or 2 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *unskilled*, able to perform perhaps the most basic techniques of a skill.
Characters with at least 3 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *amateurs* with basic training in the skill.
Characters with at least 7 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *authorities* with richer understanding of the skill.
Characters with at least 13 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *experts*.
Characters with 20 points of knowledge in a skill are considered *masters* of the skill.

The number of points of knowledge a character earns upon levelling depends on their **intelligence** and their class.

## Modal Skills

Some skills or techniques are identified as *modal*.
This means that the skill or technique is associated with a particular subcategory, based on geography, history or cultural custom.
Characters with knowledge in that skill or technique must identify which subcategory that knowledge belongs to when evaluating their understanding of said skill or technique.
Knowledge checks or techniques drawing from unfamiliar areas of these subcategories are judged to be half as effective.

As an example, a character with 6 points of knowledge of *politics* must specify to which political entity (e.g. a kingdom or empire) that knowledge applies.
For all other political entities, her knowledge is considered to be a 3.
