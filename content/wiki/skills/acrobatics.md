# Acrobatics

Acrobatics is the performance of feats of agility, balance and coordination.
It encapsulates many gymnastic abilities and control available to characters.

[Bards](./wiki/characters/bard.md) who specialize in acrobatics are understood to naturally gain acrobatics abilities as they level, without spending knowledge points.

[Monks](./wiki/characters/monk.md) and [thieves](./wiki/characters/thief.md) can study acrobatics.
