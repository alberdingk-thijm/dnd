# Alchemy

Alchemy is the art of purifying, maturing and perfecting matter.
It covers the disciplines of transmutation, the manipulation of the cardinal elements (earth, air, fire and water) and the balancing of the body's components to improve health.

**Druids**, **mages** and **illusionists** can study alchemy.
