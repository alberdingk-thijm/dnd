# Theology

Theology is the study of religion and religious practice.
It encapsulates religious techniques, histories and distinctions in orthodox versus heretical practice.

Theology is a *modal* skill: theologians must choose a **world religion** to study when investing knowledge points.
Theology knowledge points provide halved bonuses for religions outside of a theologian's specialty.

[Clerics](./wiki/characters/cleric.md) and [paladins](./wiki/characters/paladin.md) can study theology.
