# Necromancy

The study of death and the undead.
It deals with the decay and preservation of the body, resurrection and the soul.

Although necromancy is connected to religious notions, as resurrection and the undead are real, non-religious entities, a particular religious lens is not necessary to comprehend it.

[Clerics](./wiki/characters/cleric.md) and [paladins](./wiki/characters/paladin.md) can study necromancy.
