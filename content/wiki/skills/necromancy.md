# Necromancy

The study of death and the undead.
It deals with the decay and preservation of the body, resurrection and the soul.

Although necromancy is connected to religious notions, as resurrection and the undead are real, non-religious entities, a particular religious lens is not necessary to comprehend it.

[Clerics](./wiki/characters/cleric.md) and [paladins](./wiki/characters/paladin.md) can study necromancy.

## Unskilled Necromancy

Unskilled clerics (but *not paladins*) can turn undead.

### Turn Undead

To succeed, a necromancer must eschew all other action in a given round in order to will an undead creature to fall back and give ground.
The necromancer must be within 60 feet (12 combat hexes) of the creature to be turned.
During the turning attempt, the necromancer cannot move or take any other action.
Turning undead does not require concentration, however, and the effect occurs at the end of all action on the necromancer's side (before the enemy's next action).

To determine success, the necromancer rolls a d20 and consults the table below.

##### Notes on Turn Undead Table

The number in each cell indicates the *minimum* roll for success.
On a failure, the attempt to turn has no effect but may be repeated next round.

Where a 'T' is shown, the character does not need to roll; the undead is automatically turned if the necromancer wills it.
A 'D' indicates that they are able to destroy the create, banishing it to the lower planes.

A successful turn indicates that the character has literally lifted and hurled the creature back a distance of ten feet (2 hexes).
The creature is then considered 'stunned' and unable to take any aggressive action.
The character can attempt to turn creatures again and again, driving them back into rooms, causing them to plunge from high places, even pushing non-corporeal creatures through solid walls.

However, it must be noted that undead creatures with average intelligence or more (greater undead) can choose to flee - dissipating if possible, but through whatever means is available.
Note that all greater undead will retreat the moment they encounter a person who is able to turn them automatically; if the necromancer must roll a die, the creature must make an intelligence check before it decides to flee.

The maximum undead that can be affected will be one creature +1 HD per knowledge point of the necromancer.

## Amateur Necromancy

Amateur paladins may turn undead as clerics do, but they must treat their knowledge points as 2 lower for all associated checks (roll for success, number of undead turned).

Amateurs may *identify manifestations* and perform *seances*.

## Authority Necromancy

Authorities may perform *necromantic invigoration*.

## Expert Necromancy

Experts may perform *mummifications*.

## Master Necromancy

Masters may create a *phylactery*.
