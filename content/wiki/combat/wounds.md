# Wounds

When 11 or more damage results from a single physical attack, the damaged creature is said to be *wounded*.
In future rounds, until the wound is [*managed*](./wiki/combat/wounds.md#managing-wounds), the character will 'bleed' hit points each round.

The severity of the wound is based on the damage received.
For every 11 points of damage, the wound will drain the character of 1 h.p.
Thus, a 22 damage attack would cause a 2 h.p. wound; a 43 damage attack would cause a 3 h.p. wound.
Characters may receive multiple wounds at once; the wounds are counted cumulatively.

Creatures which are not composed of flesh, regenerative creatures, manifestations (demons, devils and the undead), jellies, gasses and golems all cannot be wounded.

Wound damage is not counted towards **stunning** nor does it affect a spellcaster's concentration.

## Managing Wounds

There are several techniques which will close wounds.

* The **close wound** cantrip can close one wound.
* Eating a **goodberry** will close one wound per berry.
* A **healing salve** poured into a wound will close one wound per point of healing.
* Healing spells of any kind, including a [paladin](./wiki/characters/paladin.md)'s **lay on hands**, will close all wounds.
* Wounds may also be physically bound with [bandages](./wiki/combat/wounds.md#bandages).

### Binding Wounds

To bind a wound, a creature must possess at least a low intelligence.

Binding a wound takes 3 rounds, +2 rounds per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.
Hence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 5 rounds to bind.
Note that characters trained in [medicine](./wiki/skills/medicine.md) may bind wounds in less time.

Each wound must be bound individually.

If the binding of a wound is interrupted, the wound will reopen and the binding must be started again from the beginning.

#### Bandages

Bandages can be made from any light, loose cloth material on the character's person or nearby.
These bandages are considered 'improper dressings'.

Actual bandages may be purchased at a market, and are considered to be clean, unless damaged by water, fire or another condition.
These bandages are considered 'proper dressings'.

Improper dressings, being partly soiled, have a chance of causing an infection or disease.
The chance of a random disease occurring when an improper dressing is left alone is 1 in 30.
The chance of a disease occurring if an improper dressing is removed within an hour and not replaced with a proper dressing, and the wound is left open to the air, is 1 in 20.
