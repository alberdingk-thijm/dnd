  <h1 id="wounds">Wounds</h1>
<p>When 11 or more damage results from a single physical attack, the damaged creature is said to be <em>wounded</em>.
In future rounds, until the wound is <a href="https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/combat/wounds/#managing-wounds"><em>managed</em></a>, the character will 'bleed' hit points each round.</p>
<p>The severity of the wound is based on the damage received.
For every 11 points of damage, the wound will drain the character of 1 h.p.
Thus, a 22 damage attack would cause a 2 h.p. wound; a 43 damage attack would cause a 3 h.p. wound.
Characters may receive multiple wounds at once; the wounds are counted cumulatively.</p>
<p>Creatures which are not composed of flesh, regenerative creatures, manifestations (demons, devils and the undead), jellies, gasses and golems all cannot be wounded.</p>
<p>Wound damage is not counted towards <strong>stunning</strong> nor does it affect a spellcaster's concentration.</p>
<h2 id="managing-wounds">Managing Wounds</h2>
<p>There are several techniques which will close wounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>close wound</strong> cantrip can close one wound.</li>
<li>Eating a <strong>goodberry</strong> will close one wound per berry.</li>
<li>A <strong>healing salve</strong> poured into a wound will close one wound per point of healing.</li>
<li>Healing spells of any kind, including a <a href="https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/characters/paladin/">paladin</a>'s <strong>lay on hands</strong>, will close all wounds.</li>
<li>Wounds may also be physically bound with <a href="https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/combat/wounds/#bandages">bandages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binding-wounds">Binding Wounds</h3>
<p>To bind a wound, a creature must possess at least a low intelligence.</p>
<p>Binding a wound takes 3 rounds, +2 rounds per additional level of severity of the wound beyond 1 h.p.
Hence, a wound bleeding 2 h.p. per round would take 5 rounds to bind.
Note that characters trained in <a href="https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/skills/medicine/">medicine</a> may bind wounds in less time.</p>
<p>Each wound must be bound individually.</p>
<p>While binding is taking place, the creature will cease to take damage from the wound.
If the binding of a wound is interrupted, the wound will reopen and the binding must be started again from the beginning.</p>
<h4 id="bandages">Bandages</h4>
<p>Bandages can be made from any light, loose cloth material on the character's person or nearby.
These bandages are considered 'improper dressings'.</p>
<p>Actual bandages may be purchased at a market, and are considered to be clean, unless damaged by water, fire or another condition.
These bandages are considered 'proper dressings'.</p>
<p>Improper dressings, being partly soiled, have a chance of causing an infection or disease.
The chance of a random disease occurring when an improper dressing is left alone is 1 in 30.
The chance of a disease occurring if an improper dressing is removed within an hour and not replaced with a proper dressing, and the wound is left open to the air, is 1 in 20.</p>
