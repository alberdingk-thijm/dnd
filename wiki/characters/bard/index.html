  <h1 id="bard">Bard</h1>
<p>Bards are artists seeking to create and present an artistry that will engage their audience.
Through their artistic training, they harness the wild magic of the universe and modulate it using their craft.
Bards are often sociable, joining together for performances or festivals, and at times forming colleges to establish formal aesthetics.
Other bards may instead seek independence and isolation from the rigour of the college.
Like druids, bards are not bound to a strict form of expression, but may choose to follow their artistic desires in whatever form best empowers them.
Every bard may choose an artistic path to follow, of which many exist: acting, architecture, ceramics, circus, costuming, dance, gastronomy, leathercraft, metalwork, music, painting, poetry, prose, puppetry, sculpture and woodwork.</p>
<h2 id="ability-scores">Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Bards' primary attribute is <strong>charisma</strong>.
Bards must have a wisdom of 13 or higher, an intelligence of 10 or higher, and a charisma of 15 or higher.
Multi-classed bards must have a wisdom of 15 or higher.
Bards do not receive experience point bonuses.</p>
<p>Bards play best with a high constitution for defense.
All ability scores for the bard must be 6 or higher.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>Bards use <strong>6-sided hit dice</strong>.</p>
<p>Bards may use <em>padded</em>, <em>leather</em>, <em>studded leather</em> or <em>chain mail</em> armours only.
They may not use <em>shields</em> or <em>great helmets</em>.
Bards may use the following weapons: <em>ankuses</em>, <em>bastard swords</em>, <em>bolas</em>, <em>broadswords</em>, <em>clubs</em>, <em>light crossbows</em>, <em>daggers</em>, <em>darts</em>, <em>javelins</em>, <em>longswords</em>, <em>quarterstaffs</em>, <em>scimitars</em>, <em>short hammers</em>, <em>shortswords</em>, <em>slings</em>, <em>spears</em>, <em>staff slings</em>, <em>two-handed swords</em> and <em>warhammers</em>.</p>
<p>Bards begin with <strong>two weapon proficiencies</strong> and take a -3 penalty &quot;to hit&quot; when using a weapon with which they are not proficient.</p>
<p>A new weapon proficiency is gained for every three levels above the first.</p>
<p>Bards are able to employ any magic items normally available to <strong>fighters</strong> and <strong>thieves</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Under normal circumstances, bards are able to <strong>read</strong>.</p>
<p>All bards have the ability to play <strong>martial music</strong>.</p>
<p>Bards must choose one of the aforementioned artistic forms to specialize in in addition to their usual skills.
Each time the bard gains a level, they gain a corresponding level in their specialty.
They may <em>respecialize</em> in a new form, but will begin at level 1 and have to retrain to achieve the same bonuses in their skills that they had before.
Some skills are available across forms, and will not be penalized if the bard changes specialties.
Others are only available within a specific subset of forms.</p>
<p>Skills available to bards include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>artistry</strong></li>
<li><strong>craftsmanship</strong></li>
<li><strong>creativity</strong></li>
<li><strong>engineering</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://alberdingk-thijm.github.io/dnd/wiki/skills/folklore/">folklore</a></li>
<li><strong>heraldry</strong></li>
<li><strong>history</strong></li>
<li><strong>inspiration</strong></li>
<li><strong>instruction</strong></li>
<li><strong>linguistics</strong></li>
<li><strong>performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>philosophy</strong></li>
<li><strong>physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>politics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At first level, bards gain 6 knowledge points plus any intelligence bonuses.
At first level, bards automatically gain 2 points in <strong>performance</strong> and 2 points in <strong>inspiration</strong>.
Bards gain 1d6 knowledge points per level.</p>
<h3 id="martial-music">Martial Music</h3>
<p>Bards are able to play martial music for as long as 4 round per level per day.
With each level gained, it can be supposed that the bard is able to produce musical variation to continue to inspire allies, and that their bodies can handle the strain of performance longer.</p>
<p>It requires one full round of playing before martial music can have any kind of effect; thereafter, every round the music is played will have positive effects towards the player's allies.
The bard may not perform any activity while producing martial music beyond moving 1 hex, so long as this does not move them into <strong>melee</strong>.</p>
<p>Friendly combatants within 12 hexes (60 feet) of the player will gain +1 to hit, +1 to damage and +1 morale as long as the bard is playing.
So long as the bard has not performed for the full number of rounds of martial music they may produce a day, they may stop and start again as often as they wish.
They must warm up again for one round however; note that this warm-up does not count towards the total number of rounds of martial music the bard may play in a day.</p>
<h2 id="experience-table">Experience Table</h2>
<p>Bards are limited to 23 levels.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Level</th><th>Min. XP</th><th>HD</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>

<h3 id="spell-creation">Spell Creation</h3>
<p>Unlike how other classes prepare spells, bards do so by playing an instrument, speaking poetry, producing a dance or otherwise inciting the attention of their muse.
Once the muse is paying attention, the muse produces the spell effect that the bard has invoked.</p>
<p>To incite this attention, the bard must contemplate their past experience and improve upon it to encourage the muse's engagement.</p>
<p>A bard will automatically regain any spell cast at night upon the following sunset, and any spell cast during the day upon the following sunrise, regardless of rest.</p>
<p>Additionally, bards may <strong>intoxicate</strong> themselves to obtain an 'epiphany' and restore a spell immediately.
This stimulation will typically take the form of drugs or alcohol.
How intoxicated the bard becomes will affect the level of spell they can instantly regain.
Becoming <em>flushed</em> enables the bard to restore one first or second level spell of their choice.
Becoming <em>tight</em> enables the bard to restore one third or fourth level spell of their choice.
Becoming <em>smashed</em> enables the bard to restore one fifth or sixth level spell of their choice.</p>
<p>The bard will suffer the typical intoxication penalties but not to the actual casting of their spells.</p>
