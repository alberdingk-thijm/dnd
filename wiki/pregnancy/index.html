  <h1 class="post-title">Pregnancy</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2018-05-15</span>
  <h1 id="pregnancy">Pregnancy</h1>
<p>The following pregnancy rules were created to account for two factors: the possibility of conception and the effects of pregnancy on a character.
The rules were designed to be simple enough to use on the odd occasion pregnancy comes up, while still allowing the character to participate in adventures.</p>
<h2 id="conception">Conception</h2>
<p>The chance of conception depends on contraceptive methods used by the partners prior to, during or after intercourse. There are four basic approaches available (calculated based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_birth_control_methods">effectiveness of birth control methods</a>), as follows.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Contraceptive Method</b></td><td><b>Risk of pregnancy per sexual encounter</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>None, deliberately while ovulating</td><td>5 in 20</td></tr>
<tr><td>None</td><td>1 in 20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calendar-based</td><td>1 in 20, on a 1 roll vs. lowest WIS between partners</td></tr>
<tr><td>Withdrawal method or barrier device</td><td>1 in 20, on a 1 roll vs. highest WIS between partners</td></tr>
<tr><td>Abortifacient consumed at most 8 hours after sex</td><td>1 in 200</td></tr>
</table>
Barrier devices include citrus; a mixture of cedar oil, incense and olive oil; and a mixture of honey and rock salt.
Abortifacients include pennyroyal, rue, wild carrot, silphium and nutmeg.
If a character conceives, they roll a d100. If a 1 is rolled, the character conceives twins and rolls again. Each additional 1 rolled increases the number of children by 1.
<h2 id="first-trimester-weeks-1-to-12">First Trimester (weeks 1 to 12)</h2>
<p>The first trimester is characterized by feelings of tiredness and nausea. The chance of miscarriage is relatively high, especially in women who do not experience much morning sickness.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Suffer -1 'to hit' rolls.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">After any combat in which 5 or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-3 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.</span></li>
<li>When character has not eaten within the past 8 hours, must make a save vs. poison or will vomit for 1d4 rounds. If character fails at least 10 saves, nausea continues into second trimester (hyperemesis gravidarum).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="second-trimester-weeks-13-to-28">Second Trimester (weeks 13 to 28)</h2>
<p>The second trimester is the period of significant weight gain; the character will typically gain between 10-15% of their current weight in placenta, retained fluids and baby. The character is no longer as nauseous unless they develop hyperemesis gravidarum (see first trimester, penalties). The character may begin to feel more tender and sore. The character may become constipated or have frequent urination (pressure on the bowels and bladder). The chance of miscarriage is much lower than in the first trimester.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Suffer -1 'to hit' rolls.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">After any combat in which five or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-3 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.</span></li>
<li>Character must consume an additional 1 lb. of food a day.</li>
<li>Character loses an additional 2% of their body water a day (risk of [[dehydration|Hydration]]).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="third-trimester-weeks-29-to-40">Third Trimester (weeks 29 to 40)</h2>
<p>The third trimester is similar to the second, although the baby grows much larger and heavier, causing increased muscle, girdle and back pain, and reducing the character's balance. The chance of miscarriage is quite low, but the character can enter preeclampsia (leading to seizures and/or coma) due to high blood pressure or stress.</p>
<p><strong>Penalties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Suffer -1 'to hit' rolls and DEX checks.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">After any combat in which five or more attacks have been made, must make a save vs. poison or find need to rest for 1-4 hours, or all character stats will be reduced by 25% for remainder of the day.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Character must consume an additional 1 lb. of food a day.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Character loses an additional 2% of their body water a day (risk of [[dehydration|Hydration]]).</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Whenever character's CON drops below 3, character must save vs. paralyzation or succumb to preeclampsia. The character must rest completely for 2-8 days and make a CON check each day. If more than half the checks fail, the character will enter eclampsia.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>
<p>(Work in progress.)</p>
<h2 id="miscarriage">Miscarriage</h2>
<p>Miscarriage affects around 20% of pregnancies. Miscarriage can occur naturally at any time during the pregnancy due to a number of different complications. The chance of miscarriage is highest at the beginning of the pregnancy and steadily decreases over time. Note that physical injury can increase the chance of miscarriage.
As most miscarriages are not immediately obvious to the mother until quite late in the pregnancy (or even until delivery), the DM should roll on the player's behalf.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Week</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3-12</td><td>13-14</td><td>15-21</td><td>22-26</td><td>27-33</td><td>34-40</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chance</td><td>3%</td><td>2%</td><td>1%</td><td>0.5%</td><td>0.25%</td><td>0.2%</td><td>0.1%</td><td>0.05%</td></tr>
</table>
Chance of miscarriage is rolled automatically at the end of each week.
Whenever a character is [stunned](http://tao-dndwiki.blogspot.ca/2018/02/stun-lock.html) in combat, the DM must roll double the miscarriage chance (i.e. if the character is stunned in combat during the 11th week, the miscarriage chance is 2 x 1% = 2%) immediately.
For multiple births, miscarriage chance is multiplied by the number of living offspring. Each baby miscarries separately.
